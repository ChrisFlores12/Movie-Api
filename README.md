# Movie-Api
This is a cool Springboot application tutorial that I found followed from freecodecamp that uses a mongoDb database of movies to display movies and create reviews for each movie.

I added some extra features like the update review and delete review methods to make it a fully functional crud project.

I used Postman to test the api and edited JSON data for testing the various endpoints.

I had a lot of fun doing this project and will add a front end soon to make it a complete full stack website using react.

If you have any advice or coding critiques please reach out!
